                <h3>Tetris: How a US teenager achieved the 'impossible' and what his feat tells us about human capabilities</h3>
                <p>The original Tetris designers thought it couldn't be done – the game is designed to play endlessly. The pieces fall faster and faster until a player is overwhelmed.

Baldur’s Gate 3 was crowned as game of the year (and shadow dropped on Xbox), but before we got there, viewers were subjected to a whole lot of video game news.
